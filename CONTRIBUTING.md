Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I hope you are excited to start your own journey in Cloud and learn about AWS, with me.
Thank you so much for joining in & I hope you are as excited as I am right now

Before starting out, I just quickly wanna walk you through some basic steps, that may help you to get started and even contributing to this repository!

Let's Begin ðŸš€

### Tasks:

1. The first step would be to add in your name in [LEARNERS.md](), in order for you to commit to learning something new each day and meet the fellow learners, who'll be learning along with you! 
2. Then, you can head over to the `Journey` folder and create a folder, giving that your name. 
3. This will be the folder, where you can constantly update your learnings each day or however seems comfortable with you, by creating different files, with the convention `Day-n`

## Brief Guide:

### Setting the repo in your local system:

- Click the fork button on the repo at https://github.com/verma-kunal/AWS-Learnings
Your repo will now be in your GitHub. 
- Clone the repo to your computer with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubname>/AWS-Learnings.git 
```
- Branch away from the `main` branch and use the following schema for naming your branches:
```
git checkout -b add-kunalverma-to-journey 
```

### Adding your name:
- Add your name to the [LEARNERS.md]() with your name, github handle, and share about your main goal of joining the journey.  
You can add your line to the bottom of the previous line: (would eventually increase)
```
| [Kunal Verma](https://github.com/verma-kunal) | Targeting the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification & exploring the world of Cloud |
```

### Creating your learnings folder:
- You can simply create a folder with `your name` inside `Journey` folder!
- Update your learnings each-day in this particular folder


### Commiting code & creating a PR:

- Add your changes with the following command:
```
git add .
```
`.` refers to all the files/folders you have changed! (You can mention separately as well)
- Commit your changes, make sure you sign off your commits by using the `-s` parameter
```
git commit -s -m "add <yourname> to the journey"
```
- Push your changes (to your local repo), use your branch name you created above:
```
git push origin add-kunalverma-to-journey 
```

After this, you can visit your forked repo & there you'll find an option to create a PR.
Congratulations!! You have now created your first pull request to this repo.
